# The Free-Code-Camp Weather App
For this project I used HTML, CSS and Javascript.
In this project you have to get the latitude and longitude of the user from the browser using HTML5 Geolocation, then make a GET request using Ajax to the Open-Weather API and working with the returned JSON data to display the information needed like the Location and Country, temperature and so.
